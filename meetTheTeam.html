                    Being a Washington resident, I travelled often to Seattle. 
                    During my visits the large population of people suffering from hunger and 
                    homelessness always stood out to me, but I never knew how to make a difference. 
                    That was until I heard about WashPIRG’s Hunger and Homelessness campaign. 
                    This campaign gave me the tools I needed to make a difference and to give others 
                    like me who didn’t know where to start, the opportunity to make a difference.

                    I learned about WashPIRG through the fall kickoff event held at UW. The H&H campaign
                    specifically stood out to me because of its tight-knit community. Everyone
                    seemed to get along and was so friendly, I couldn't help but attend a few meetings. 
                    After working with the campaign for a few months, I have learned so much and 
                    contributed to direct change which has been so fulfilling.

                    I felt the need to join WashPIRG’s H&H campaign after 
                    realizing how difficult it is to navigate food and housing insecurity 
                    alone. In Fall 2022, I faced unexpected financial hardship that left 
                    me briefly homeless and scared to spend money on food. 
                    It took months of searching to get connected with resources that drastically 
                    improved my situation, and I felt inspired to help others 
                    find assistance they didn’t know existed. When I heard about the H&H 
                    campaign through a class announcement, I knew I had to go to the kickoff 
                    meeting! Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to work with a bunch of amazing 
                    people and fight to end the issues that put me (and so many others) in such a 
                    difficult situation.

                    I joined washpirg because I believe in contributing to the communities 
                    you’re in and that large scale change starts with making connections on an 
                    individual level with the people around you. Being volunteer coordinator for 
                    H&H has allowed me to build those relationships and contribute to that community 
                    in a meaningful way.
